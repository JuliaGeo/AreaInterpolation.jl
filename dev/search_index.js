It assumes that no sharp boundaries exist in the distribution of the  allocated data, which may not be the case, for example, when target zones are divided  by linear features (rivers, railways, roads) or are adjacent to waterbodies. \n\nHowever, it generates intuitively elegant allocations for many urban case studies with  many applications (Kounadi, Ristea, Leitner, & Langford, 2018; Comber, Proctor, & Anthony, 2008).\n\nThis description was taken in part from the GIS&T Body of Knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"}]
